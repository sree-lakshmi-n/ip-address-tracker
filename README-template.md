## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

Learnt to make an API call using fetch API, Async and Await.

```js
async function getQuote() {
  let response = await fetch(url);
  let data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

getQuote().then((data) => console.log(data));
```

For getting client's IP address using Geo Ipify API, the url is

```js
"https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city?apiKey=at_vMIjof1g6XVqaF1luAuKpjEHZwIvf";
```

Else, the url is

```js
"https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city?apiKey=at_vMIjof1g6XVqaF1luAuKpjEHZwIvf&ipAddress=${ipAddress}";
```

Calling a JS function on submitting a form

```html
<form action="javascript:displayIPDetails()"></form>
```

Also, learnt border-radius doesn't work for form.
We have to set border-radius for its elements, if needed.

```css
.search-bar-input {
  border-top-left-radius: 1.3rem;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 1.3rem;
}
```

To resolve the 'map container is already initialized' error, remove the previous map before adding the next one.

```js
map.remove();
```

### Continued development

Implement the same project with ReactJS
